<p>Meredith is a 20-something aspiring web developer. In her free time, she attends school at Saint Paul College, bothers her two cats
(Bellatrix & Rosemary), & enjoys a variety of crafty things. Craft brews to Pinterest crafts, she'll try anything once! And probably regret it later...
<p>You'll most often find Meredith at home, watching Netflix and baking, or perhaps, out with friends and acquaintances! Or you won't find her at all. You stalker.
